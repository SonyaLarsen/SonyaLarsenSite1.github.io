                <p> This easy pizza dough recipe is great for beginners and produces a soft homemade pizza crust.
                    Skip the pizza delivery because you only need 6 basic ingredients to begin!This is my go-to pizza dough recipe.
                    It was published on my blog 6 years ago and after making it for the millionth time, I decided it’s time for an update
                    with a video tutorial and clearer recipe instructions. .</p>

                <p class="p1">Pancakes</p>
                <p> Here is an easy recipe of my pancakes. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter;
                    mix until smooth.
                    Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle,
                    using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</p>

                <p class="p1">Ratatouille</p>
                <p> It’s ratatouille season! Ratatouille is a classic end-of-summer French stew that’s fun to say (rat-tuh-TOO-ee) and fun to make.
                    It’s packed with fresh produce: tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini and yellow squash, and bell pepper.
                    This summer, we sampled authentic French ratatouille in Provence.
                    I liked some ratatouille more than others, so I vowed to come up with my own favorite ratatouille recipe when I came home. </p>
